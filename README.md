# Integration-of-Multiomics
Integrating multiomics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) using the multiGSEA package to perform pathway-centric analysis. This approach enables a comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms and cellular responses by leveraging the GSEA method for combined analysis of genes, proteins, and metabolites.

A.multiGSEA Workflow:
It has 3 major three steps:
1. Preparing Pathways and Omics Data:
    multiGSEA gathers pathway definitions for different omics data from multiple databases (like KEGG and Reactome), which may use different ID formats. The graphite package standardizes these definitions by converting all identifiers into a common format. This enables multiGSEA to work across databases seamlessly, ensuring consistent pathway analysis across omics layers.

2. Single-Omics Gene Set Enrichment Analysis:
  performs enrichment analysis on each type of omics data (e.g., genes, proteins, metabolites) individually. This single-omics analysis identifies which genes or proteins are actively involved in the biological process under study. Each omics layer is analyzed separately to determine which gene sets are "enriched," or notably active, in response to a condition or treatment.

3. Combined Multi-Omics Enrichment:
   After analyzing each omics layer separately, multiGSEA integrates the results to create a comprehensive view of cellular responses. By combining data from transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, it reveals interactions between genes, proteins, and small molecules. This multi-omics approach uncovers complex cellular activities that might not be visible in a single omics analysis, offering a fuller picture of biological processes.
