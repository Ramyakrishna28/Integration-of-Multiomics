# Integration-of-Multiomics
Integrating multiomics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) using the multiGSEA package to perform pathway-centric analysis. This approach enables a comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms and cellular responses by leveraging the GSEA method for combined analysis of genes, proteins, and metabolites.
